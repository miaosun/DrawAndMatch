# DrawAndMatch
The inspiration of this game was generated during Anvil Hackathon in Goldsmiths College, London. 
The main target of this game are children, to learn and improve shape recognition and drawing skills. It can be extended to teach letters and numbers, user has the possibility to import their own drawings. 
We are proud of the achievement of the game, since we were not familiar with the environment and framework used in this game.
